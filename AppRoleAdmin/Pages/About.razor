<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    The App Role Admin sample application demonstrates how to use Blazorade Id to acquire Microsoft Graph
    access tokens on demand and perform end to end management of application roles in Microsoft Entra ID.
    The application is intentionally focused on the tasks that the Entra portal handles poorly.
    It gives administrators a direct, streamlined interface for working with app roles without
    navigating through multiple disconnected UI surfaces.

<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">

    This sample does not bypass or relax Entra permissions. It only enables functionality that the signed 
    in user is already authorized to perform. If the user lacks the necessary delegated Graph permissions, 
    the application exposes nothing beyond authentication.

<MudText Typo="Typo.h2">Key Capabilities</MudText>
<ul>
    <li>List all applications in the tenant that define one or more app roles</li>
    <li>View the full role definitions for a selected application</li>
    <li>Add new app roles, update existing roles, or remove unused roles</li>
    <li>Resolve the resource service principal corresponding to the selected application</li>
    <li>List existing group assignments for each app role</li>
    <li>Assign app roles to security groups</li>
    <li>Remove role assignments from security groups</li>
    <li>Acquire and refresh Microsoft Graph tokens automatically using Blazorade Id’s on demand flow</li>
</ul>

    <MudText Typo="Typo.h2">Why This Sample Exists</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    Administrators often need to define app roles for custom applications and assign those roles to security 
    groups to control downstream access. While the Entra portal technically supports these tasks, it splits 
    them across multiple disconnected interfaces, making the workflow slow and error prone. This sample shows 
    how Blazorade Id can support delegated Microsoft Graph operations from a Blazor WebAssembly application and 
    delivers a focused UI that makes app role administration significantly more efficient.

        <MudText Typo="Typo.h2">Required Delegated Microsoft Graph Permissions</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    In order to run this sample app, you need to configure it with the following delegated Microsoft Graph permissions:
</MudText>
<ul>
    <li>Application.ReadWrite.All</li>
    <li>AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All</li>
    <li>Directory.Read.All</li>
</ul>
